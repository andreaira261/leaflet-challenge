# Module 15 Challenge 

### Leaflet Challenge

In this assignment, we created an earthquake visualization by fetching data from a geojson API. We created earthquake markers on the map, with the size of each marker corresponding to the earthquake's magnitude, and the marker's color reflecting the earthquake's depth. Additionally, we implemented tooltips for each data point, offering essential details about the earthquake, including its magnitude, location, and depth.
